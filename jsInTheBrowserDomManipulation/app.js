// Taste of the DOM
// The DOM is a Javascript representation of a webpage
// It's your JS "Window" into the contents of a webpage
// It's just a bunch of objects that you can interact with via JS
// HTML & CSS go in and JS Objects come out
// You can play with this in the console of the browser to see the objects and manipulate the DOM for testing

// Another Fun DOM Example
// We can try out new things by creating a code snippet in the chrome console. This can found under sources > snippets

// The Document Object
