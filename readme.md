# New Modern Javascript Bootcamp 2020

## This readme is for an overview of the entire course.

### Sections 1 - 6 were basically review for me. I had recently learned these concepts in Colt's Web Developer Bootcamp, however, it was mostly in an early version of Javascript. This was the first time I was using "let" and "const" as well as template literals and ternary operator.

Ugh, can I please just figure this out.
