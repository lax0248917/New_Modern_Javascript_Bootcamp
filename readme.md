# New Modern Javascript Bootcamp 2020

## This readme is for an overview of the entire course.

### All notes will be added to better document my experience as I work through this course. These notes will be made public in Github and the repo that has been allocated to track my progress.

### Sections 1 - 6 were basically review for me. I had recently learned these concepts in Colt's Web Developer Bootcamp, however, it was mostly in an early version of Javascript. This was the first time I was using "let" and "const" as well as template literals and ternary operator.

## Well it happened again, here I was thinking I was going to be able to complete this course and life got in the way. I truly need to learn this material and cement these concepts. I don't believe I need to start over, but I am going to do a little review of functions and then move on from there. Probably wouldn't hurt to reference array methods along the way as well. Ugh, can I please just figure this out.
